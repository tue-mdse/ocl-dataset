  "description": "The OntoUML lightweight editor (OLED) is an environment for the development, evaluation and implementation of domain ontologies using the UFO-based ontologically well-founded modeling language OntoUML. The tool provides a simple, lightweight and integrated set of features to ontology engineers, such as syntactical verification, visual simulation, model checking, model inference, automatic semantic-anti-patterns detection and correction, validation of part-hood relations and ontology patterns. The tool aggregates many direct and indirect contributions for NEMO http://nemo.inf.ufes.br/ research group members.",
