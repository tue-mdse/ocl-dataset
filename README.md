# A Data Set of OCL Expressions on GitHub

This dataset contains 9188 OCL expressions originating from 504 EMF meta-models in 245 systematically selected GitHub repositories. Both the original meta-models and the generated abstract syntax trees are included, allowing for a variety of empirical studies of the OCL.

The dataset is presented in a paper published at MSR 2017:
